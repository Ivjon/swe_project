ROJECT TITLE: Ilir Subashi Economist Management System
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Our team met with the management team of Ilir Subashi Metal Supplier small company in Vore. The thorough need analysis which was performed by our team revealed that the company continuously faced difficulties managing its inventory and financial transactions by manual record keeping. As the company has grown in the number of transactions and inventory, the issues with manual record keeping have continued increasing. Thus, the need for a centralized inventory economist management system has become crucial in order for the company to minimize these inefficiencies in their inventory management of the product list. Thus, this centralized inventory economist management system will be able to manage the administrative tasks, inventory tasks, and economist tasks effectively and efficiently.
SOLUTION PROPOSAL: The Ilir Subashi Management System will offer the solution of a user-friendly designed interface through which economists, administrators, and workers can successfully achieve an efficient performance for each of their respective, required tasks within the company, no longer through manual record keeping, and as a result continuously updated information simultaneously so there are no inefficiencies and a real-time update of productÂ inventory.
