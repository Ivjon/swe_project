ROJECT TITLE:Subashi Metal Economist Management System

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Our team met with the management team of Ilir Subashi Metal Supplier small company in Vore. The thorough need analysis which was performed by our team revealed that the company continuously faced difficulties managing its inventory and financial transactions by manual record keeping. As the company has grown in the number of transactions and inventory, the issues with manual record keeping have continued increasing. Thus, the need for a centralized inventory economist management system has become crucial in order for the company to minimize these inefficiencies in their inventory management of the product list. Thus, this centralized inventory economist management system will be able to manage the administrative tasks, inventory tasks, and economist tasks effectively and efficiently.

SOLUTION PROPOSAL: The Ilir Subashi Management System will offer the solution of a user-friendly designed interface through which economists, administrators, and workers can successfully achieve an efficient performance for each of their respective, required tasks within the company, no longer through manual record keeping, and as a result continuously updated information simultaneously so there are no inefficiencies and a real-time update of product inventory.
Features and Technologies: Interface That's Easy to Use: -User-friendly design that makes it simple to navigate and operate, guaranteeing rapid user adoption. Centralized dashboard -A unified dashboard with rapid access to pertinent capabilities and individualized overviews for workers, economists, and administrators. Access Control Based on Roles (RBAC): -Distinct user roles for workers, economists, and administrators to guarantee safe access and features tailored to their respective tasks. Inventory Management Done Automatically: -Reduced human error and offered a real-time updating of the product inventory through streamlined procedures for adding, removing, and searching goods. Automating Financial Transactions: -Automated financial transaction recording that guarantees accuracy and makes it easier to observe financial activity in real time. Generation of Receipts: -Productive generation of receipts, accurately recording key information including the product ID, name, quantity, cost, total, and balance. The technology makes processing payments or printing simple. Analytics & Reporting: -Reporting capabilities that enable data-driven decision-making by allowing economists to examine financial performance and inventory patterns. Architecture that is Scalable: -A system that can be expanded to accommodate the company's future needs in terms of features, users, and goods.

Technologies: Backend and Frontend: We plan to use the NetBeans program with Java Programming Language. On the backend side, we create files, the connection to the database and develop the features. Whilst on frontend, NetBeans offers a pallet of elements from textboxes, buttons, labels, dates etc, that are to be used with formatting the register files, login, dashboard and adding color to them. Database: For the database of the project we use MySql from Xampp. The tables of admin, employee, product etc, are connected to the forms from the application.

PROJECT SCOPE: The Ilir Subashi Management system is a software solution for the challenges that the business faces in manual inventory management and offers a more efficient and centralized operation. We aim to create a user-friendly interface for administrators, economists and workers, and subsequently enhance their performance and efficiency.

CHOSEN DEVELOPMENT MODEL State the chosen development model, such as Agile, Waterfall, or Scrum. Justification: Briefly explain the rationale behind selecting this model. -Our chosen development model for this project is the Waterfall model. The Waterfall development model has been selected for the development of the Ilir Subashi Economist Management System. -First of all, this model provides a sequential approach to software development of the project, ideal as each phase of the project will be completed before going towards the next. The nature of our project aligns perfectly with this methodology, providing us with systematic progression from the gathering of requirements from user to the final implementation of the project. -Waterfall offers predictability and stability in project planning and execution. By defining requirements upfront and following a linear progression through development phases, stakeholders can have a clear understanding of project timelines, costs, and deliverables. -The Waterfall method divides the project into well-defined, distinct phases, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. This clarity within all of the project phases will ensure the clear definition of each stage, the specific required objectives and deliverables, leading towards better control and management of our project. -Waterfall also minimizes changes to requirements once the project has started, as each phase is completed sequentially. Since in this project we expect the requirements to remain stable throughout the development lifecycle, this model is advantageous and suitable. In our case, the requirements are unlikely to change significantly and are well-understood. In the case of our project Ilir Subashi Economist Management System, we have thoroughly analyzed the scope and requirements during Phase 1, thus Waterfall provides a suitable framework for development.

Administrators may have additional settings for managing user accounts, permissions, and system configurations.
e. SECURITY MEASURES Briefly discuss the security measures and protocols implemented. Touch upon encryption, authentication, and any other security features.

User Authentication
Users are required to authenticate themselves using a username and password before accessing the system.
Strong password policies are enforced, requiring users to create passwords with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Passwords are securely stored using cryptographic hashing algorithms to prevent unauthorized access in case of a data breach.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Access control mechanisms are implemented based on user roles (e.g., administrators, economists, workers) to restrict access to specific functionalities and data. - Each user is assigned a role with predefined permissions, ensuring that they can only perform actions relevant to their job responsibilities.
Data Encryption:
Data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using secure communication protocols such as HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS).
Encryption algorithms are used to encrypt sensitive data stored in the database, ensuring that it remains protected even if unauthorized access occurs.
Session Management:
Sessions are managed securely to prevent session hijacking or fixation attacks. - Session tokens are generated using strong random number generators and are invalidated after a predefined period of inactivity or upon logout.
